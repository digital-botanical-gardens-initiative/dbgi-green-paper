## Dissemination of the results {.page_break_before}

The DBGI conducts this project following the Open Science principles, and by following the [Open Notebook Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-notebook_science) concepts. This approach allows all research artifacts (e.g. research proposals, drafts, ideas, source code, raw and processed data etc.) produced in the frame of the DBGI to be publicly available immediately, from the moment of their production, and not only after peer-reviewed publication.
To implement the DBGI Open Notebook we employ [Dendron](https://www.dendron.so/), an open-source and lightweight note-taking and knowledge management software. Dendrons are built using an ingenious system of markdown files hierarchically organized based on their filename. This allows for extremely efficient note searching and refactoring of the hierarchies. Dendrons can be conveniently shared across members of the DBGI, versioned via git and automatically published as websites. The DBGI Dendron can be browsed at <http://www.dbgi.org/dendron-dbgi/>. 
Regarding raw data sharing, specimen-related information are hosted on the iNaturalist DBGI project  home page and pictures are shared under a permissive CC0 license allowing further reuse in Wikidata for example. Mass spectrometry profiles and metabolite annotation files will be hosted on the [MassIVE data platform](https://massive.ucsd.edu/) where they will benefit from a permanent DOI.  
All the code written in the frame of the DBGI will be publicly shared and versioned through the [DBGI Github organization](https://github.com/digital-botanical-gardens-initiative). Ideas, comments and issues will be collected using [Github discussions](https://github.com/digital-botanical-gardens-initiative/forum/discussions).
